# Success
<!-- 
Projects should have a definition of done that is measurable, and a thorough understanding going in of what the risks are to delivery 
-->

## Definition of done
<!-- 
What does success look like? 
-->
We can interact with a `PostgreSQL` database from R by using `dplyr` workflow and people use it because the documentation is clear and there are good tutorials.

## Measuring success
<!-- 
How will we know when success is achieved, what markers can we use along the way 
-->
Increased number of users of the spatial database interface.

## Future work
<!-- 
How could this be extended / developed in the future by yourself and/or the community in general?
-->
This work hopefully makes it easier to add support for other spatial databases (table 1).

## Key risks
<!-- 
What sort of things could come up that can delay or break the project?

 - [ ] People
 - [ ] Processes
 - [ ] Tooling & Technology
 - [ ] Costs
